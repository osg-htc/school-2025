# Continue Your Access to the OSPool

<<<<<<< HEAD
Any U.S.-based researcher with an academic affiliation can use the OSPool indefinitely, with no allocation 
or cost to you. Your access to the OSPool is temporaryâ€”if you'd like to continue your access to the OSPool, follow the instructions below!

## Option 1: Schedule a consultation at the School (preferred)

To continue using your account beyond the School, please schedule a consultation with one of the facilitators during the School! Information on how to schedule a consultation will be provided at the School or via Slack.

In this consultation, we'll chat with you one-on-one about your research and help set up a project to ensure you can use the OSPool for your research computing needs!

## Option 2: Submit an application after the School

If you are unable to schedule a consultation during the School or decide to continue your access at a later date, complete the following steps.



Please complete the following steps by July 31: 

1. Go to this link: [Project Creation Form](https://topology.opensciencegrid.org/generate_project_yaml)
1. Fill out the form.

    !!! note
	    If the Project Name doesn't auto-populate, use `OSG_School_2025`. 
	
	After completing the form, click "Submit manually":
