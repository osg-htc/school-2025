Jump to [local transportation](#local-transportation) below for suggestions about getting around Madison.

## Computer Sciences Building, Room 1240

Most School sessions are held in **Room 1240**.
If you enter the building from Dayton Street:

1.  Enter straight into the building from the street
1.  Immediately turn left and go through two sets of doors
1.  Pass the elevator (on your right) and walk down the hallway
1.  Room 1240 is on your right up the few steps

There are signs around the building directing you to room 1240.

### Restrooms

Restrooms are across the hallway and a bit to the right of 1240.

Gender-neutral bathrooms are on office floors upstairs in a separate wing: Rooms 4329, 5329, 6329, 7329. Labeled as "toilet".

For those, or other options, just ask staff!

## Local Transportation

You are responsible for your own transportation within Madison, but we will help
coordinate and can reimburse costs between the airport and your hotel.

## Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel

The best option for travel between the Madison airport (Dane County Regional Airport) and the [School hotel](hotel.md) is the [hotel shuttle](#hotel-shuttle) service. Otherwise, you may use a ride-sharing service or taxi.

<span style="color: #FF6600;">We will help organize groups</span> to take shuttles and taxis,
based on arrival and departure times. Shuttle/taxi groups will be formed and emailed shortly before the School itself.

## Travel Between the Hotel and Campus

The two options we recommend are:

* **Walking.** The hotel is 1.3 miles away from the School. Weather is generally great during summer months, and the route is pedestrian-friendly.
* [**Hotel shuttle service**](#hotel-shuttle) may be available, especially if organized in advance.

## Options for Getting Around

### Hotel Shuttle

The [Park Hotel](hotel.md) operates a free shuttle service.
The shuttle **may not be available** at all times, though, and it is best to plan ahead.
Work with the hotel staff, individually or even better in groups, to use the shuttle.
We will help organize groups for the shuttle for airport arrivals on Sunday and departures on Saturday.

To ask about the shuttle:

* Stop by the front desk of the hotel
* Call +1&nbsp;(608)&nbsp;285-8000 and press 0 for the front desk.
* Explain that you are a guest at the hotel and ask if the shuttle is available for the number of people in your group; be clear about where you want to go from and to and at what time.

We will send the hotel our list of groups who would like the shuttle for airport trips,
but it is still best for the leader of each group to check with the hotel anyway.

### Walking

It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison campus,
with many Madison landmarks within a mile of the School and your hotel.

* Use [an app](#apps) or ask us or your hotel for a map.
* State Street&nbsp;&mdash; which connects the Capitol Square with the UW campus&nbsp;&mdash;
is full of great restaurants, shops, and attractions, and is worth walking along while you are here.

### City of Madison Metro Bus Service

Many [Madison Metro](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro) buses stop near the hotel and
pass through the University of Wisconsin&ndash;Madison campus.

* Bus fare is $2.00. 
* There are several ways to pay. On any bus, you can use the Madison Metro app. 
On regular routes, you can pay with cash. On the 
rapid routes (A, B, F), you usually need to buy a ticket from the ticket machine 
at the bus station. 
* To set up the app:

	* Once the app is downloaded, create an account.

* To use the app: 
	* When the bus is arriving, access your barcode:
		* Choose the menu button on the top right.
		* Select "My account."

	* Scan the barcode on the middle part of the bus scanner. [See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asefIj2XWJU).
* If paying with cash and using a transfer, ask the driver for a free transfer pass upon boarding.
* There's a useful [fare FAQ here](https://www.cityofmadison.com/metro/fares/fast-fares).
