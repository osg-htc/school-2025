Software Exercise 4.2: Writing a Wrapper Script
============================================================

**Objective**: Run downloaded software files via an intermediate, "wrapper" script. 

**Why learn this?**: This change is a good test of your general HTCondor knowledge and 
how to translate between executable and submit file. Using wrapper scripts is also a 
common practice for managing what happens in a job. 

Background
----------

Wrapper scripts are a useful tool for running software that can't be compiled into one piece, needs to be installed with every job, or just for running extra steps.  A wrapper script can either install the software from the source code, or use an already existing software (as in this exercise). Not only does this portability technique work with almost any kind of software that can be locally installed, it also allows for a great deal of control and flexibility for what happens within your job. Once you can write a script to handle your software (and often your data as well), you can submit a large variety of workflows to a distributed computing system like the OSPool.

For this exercise, we will write a wrapper script as an alternate way to run the same job as the previous exercise. 

Wrapper Script, part 1
----------------------

Our wrapper script will be a bash script that runs several commands.

1. In the same directory as the last exercise, make a file called `run_blast.sh`. 

1. The first line we'll place in the script is the basic command for running blast. Based on our previous submit file, what command needs to go into the script? 

1. Once you have an idea, check against the example below:  

        :::bash
        #!/bin/bash
        
        ./ncbi-blast-2.15.0+/bin/blastx -db pdbaa/pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out results.txt


Submit File Changes
-------------------

We now need to make some changes to our submit file.

1. Make a copy of your previous submit file and open it to edit. 

1. Since we are now using a wrapper script, that will be our job's executable. Replace the original `blastx` exeuctable with the name of our wrapper script and comment out the arguments line.  

        :::file
        executable = run_blast.sh 
        #arguments = 

1. Note that since the `blastx` program is no longer listed as the executable, it will be need to be included in `transfer_input_files`. Instead of transferring just that program, we will transfer the original downloaded `tar.gz` file. To achieve efficiency, we'll also transfer the <span style="color:BLUE">pdbaa database</span> as the original `tar.gz` file instead of as the unzipped folder: 

        :::console
        transfer_input_files = pdbaa.tar.gz, mouse.fa, ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz

1. If you really want to be on top of things, look at the log file for the last exercise, and update your memory and disk requests to be just slightly above the actual "Usage" values in the log. 

1. Before submitting, make sure to make the below additional changes to the wrapper script!

Wrapper Script, part 2
----------------------

Now that our database and BLAST software are being transferred to the job as `tar.gz` files, our script needs to accommodate.

1. Opening your `run_blast.sh` script, add two commands at the start to un-tar the BLAST and pdbaa `tar.gz` files. See the [previous exercise](part4-ex1-download.md) if you're not sure what these commands looks like. 

1. In order to distinguish this job from our previous job, change the output file name to something besides `results.txt`. 

1. The completed script `run_blast.sh` should look like this: 

        :::bash
        #!/bin/bash
        
        tar -xzf ncbi-blast-2.15.0+-x64-linux.tar.gz 
        tar -xzf pdbaa.tar.gz

        ./ncbi-blast-2.15.0+/bin/blastx -db pdbaa/pdbaa -query mouse.fa -out results2.txt

1.  While not strictly necessary, it's a good idea to enable executable permissions on the wrapper script, like so: 

        :::console
        username@login $ chmod u+x run_blast.sh

Your job is now ready to submit. Submit it using `condor_submit` and monitor using `condor_q`.

Apply to Your Work
------------------

1. How could you use a wrapper script to execute multiple commands in one job?

1. Would it be easier to manage the files for your job if you used compressed files like .tar.gz?

1. What other tasks could you perform inside of the job as part of the wrapper script?
