HTC Exercise 1.3: Run Jobs!
==============================

Exercise Goal
-------------

The goal of this exercise is to submit jobs to HTCondor and have them run on the OSPool. This is a huge step in learning to use an HTC system!

**This exercise will take longer than the first two, short ones. If you are having any problems getting the jobs to run, please ask the instructors! It is very important that you know how to run jobs.**

Running Your First Job
----------------------

When you want to run an HTCondor job, you will first need to write an HTCondor submit file for it. In this exercise, you will run the same `hostname` command as in Exercise 1.1, but this time, the command will run within a job on one of the *execution points* (aka a machine) in the OSPool, instead of the access point.

First, create an example submit file called `hostname.sub` using your favorite text editor (e.g., `nano`, `vim`) and then transfer the following information to that file:

``` file
executable = /bin/hostname

output = hostname.out
error = hostname.err
log = hostname.log

request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 1GB
request_disk = 1GB

requirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9")

queue
```

Save your submit file using the name `hostname.sub`.

!!! note
    You can name the HTCondor submit file using any filename. 
    It's a good practice to always include the `.sub` extension, but it is not required. 
    This is because the submit file is a simple text file that we are using to pass information to HTCondor.

The lines of the submit file have the following meanings:

| Submit Command  | Explanation                                                                                                                                                                |
|:----------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `executable`    | The name of the program to run (relative to the directory from which you submit).                                                                                          |
| `output`        | The filename where HTCondor will write the standard output from your job.                                                                                                  |
| `error`         | The filename where HTCondor will write the standard error from your job. This particular job is not likely to have any, but it is best to include this line for every job. |
| `log`           | The filename where HTCondor will write information about your job run. While not required, it is a **really** good idea to have a log file for every job.                  |
| `request_*`     | How many `cpus`, `memory`, and `disk` we want. In this case, we don't need much because the 'hostname' executable is very small.                               |
| `requirements`     | Other requirements for our jobs. In this example, we request machines with the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 operating system.                              |
| `queue`         | Tells HTCondor to run your job with the settings above.                                                                                                                    |

Note that we are not using the `arguments` or `transfer_input_files` lines that were mentioned during lecture because the `hostname` program is all that needs to be transferred from the access point server, and we want to run it without any additional options.

Double-check your submit file, so that it matches the text above. Then, tell HTCondor to run your job:

``` console
[username@ap40 ~]$ condor_submit hostname.sub
Submitting job(s).
1 job(s) submitted to cluster NNNN.
```

The actual cluster number will be shown instead of `NNNN`. **If, instead of the text above, there are error messages, read them carefully and then try to correct your submit file or ask for help.**

Notice that `condor_submit` returns back to the shell prompt right away. It does **not** wait for your job to run. Instead, as soon as it has finished submitting your job into the queue, the submit command finishes.

### View your job in the queue

Now, use `condor_q` and `condor_q -nobatch` to watch for your job in the queue! 

You may not even catch the job in the `R` running state, because the `hostname` command runs very quickly. When the job itself is finished, it will 'leave' the queue and no longer be listed in the `condor_q` output.

After the job finishes, check for the `hostname` output in `hostname.out`, which is where job information printed to the terminal screen will be printed for the job.

``` console
[username@ap40 ~]$ cat hostname.out
e4017
```

The `hostname.err` file should be empty, unless there were issues running the `hostname` executable after it was transferred to the slot. The `hostname.log` is more complex and will be the focus of a later exercise.

## Running a Job With Arguments

Very often, when you run a command on the command line, it includes arguments (i.e. options) after the program name.

In an HTCondor submit file, the program (or 'executable') name goes in the `executable` statement and **all remaining arguments** go into an `arguments` statement. For example, if the full command is:

``` console
[username@ap40 ~]$ sleep 60
```

Then in the submit file, we would put the location of the "sleep" program (you can find it with `which sleep`) as the job `executable`, and `60` as the job `arguments`:

``` file
executable = /bin/sleep
arguments = 60
```

Letâ€™s try a job submission with arguments. We will use the `sleep` command shown above, which does nothing (i.e., puts the job to sleep) for the specified number of seconds, then exits normally. It is convenient for simulating a job that takes a while to run.

Create a new submit file and save the following text in it.

``` file
executable = /bin/sleep
arguments = 60

output = sleep.out
error = sleep.err
log = sleep.log

request_cpus = 1
request_memory = 1GB
request_disk = 1GB

requirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9")

queue
```
You can save the file using any name, but as a reminder, we recommend it uses the `.sub` file extension. 

Except for changing a few filenames, this submit file is nearly identical to the last one, except for the addition of the `arguments` line.

Submit this new job to HTCondor. Again, watch for it to run using `condor_q` and `condor_q -nobatch`; 
check once every 15 seconds or so. 
Once the job starts running, it will take about 1 minute to run (reminder: the `sleep` command is telling the job to do nothing for 60 seconds), 
so you should be able to see it running for a bit. 
When the job finishes, it will disappear from the queue, but there will be no output in the output or error files, because `sleep` does not produce any output.

Running a Script Job From the Submit Directory
----------------------------------------------

So far, we have been running programs (executables) that come with the standard Linux system. 
Most likely, you will want to run a program that exists within your directory 
or perhaps a shell script of commands that you'd like to run within a job. In this example, you will write a shell script and a submit file that runs the shell script within a job:

1. Put the following contents into a file named `test-script.sh`:

        :::bash
        #!/bin/sh
        # START
        echo 'Date: ' `date` 
        echo 'Host: ' `hostname` 
        echo 'System: ' `uname -spo` 
        echo "Program: $0" 
        echo "Args: $*"
        echo 'ls: ' `ls`
        # END

1. Add executable permissions to the file (so that it can be run as a program):

        :::console
        [username@ap40 ~]$ chmod +x test-script.sh

1. Test your script from the command line:

        :::console
        [username@ap40 ~]$ ./test-script.sh hello 42
        Date:  Thu May 1 10:21:54 AM CDT 2025
        Host:  ospool-ap2140
        System:  Linux x86_64 GNU/Linux
        Program: ./test-script.sh
        Args: hello 42
        ls:  hostname.err hostname.log hostname.out hostname.sub sleep.log sleep.sub test-script.sh

    If you cannot run your executable from the command line, HTCondor probably cannot run it on another machine. It's important to test your code before you submit it as a job, but be aware that you should *never* run compute-heavy code directly on the access point.

1. Write the submit file (this should be getting easier by now):

        :::file
        executable = test-script.sh
        arguments = foo bar baz

        output = script.out
        error = script.err
        log = script.log

        request_cpus = 1
        request_memory = 1GB
        request_disk = 1GB

        requirements = (OSGVO_OS_STRING == "RHEL 9")

        queue

    In this example, the `executable` that was named in the submit file did **not** start with a `/`, 
        so the location of the file is relative to the submit directory itself. 
        In other words, in this format the executable must be in the same directory as the submit file.

    !!! note
        Blank lines between commands and spaces around the `=` do not matter to HTCondor.
        For example, this submit file is equivalent to the one above:
        
            :::file
            executable = test-script.sh
            arguments =  foo bar baz
            output =     script.out
            error =      script.err
            log =        script.log
     
            request_cpus=1
            request_memory=1GB
            request_disk=1GB
    
            queue
        
        Use whitespace to make things clear to **you**, the user. 

1.  Submit the job, wait for it to finish, and check the standard output file (and standard error file, which should be empty).

    What do you notice about the lines returned for "Program" and "ls"? Remember that only files pertaining
    to **this** job will be in the job working directory on the execute point server. You're also seeing the effects
    of HTCondor's need to standardize some filenames when running your job, though they are named as you expect 
    in the submission directory (per the submit file contents).

## Extra Challenge

!!! note
    There are Extra Challenges throughout the school curriculum. You may be better off coming back to these after you've completed all other exercises for your current working session.

Below is a Python script that does something similar to the shell script above. Write a submit file and submit a job that runs this Python script.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3
