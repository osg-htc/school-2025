Travel Between the Madison Airport and Your Hotel \u00b6 For travel between the Madison airport (Dane County Regional Airport) and the School hotel , the best option is the hotel shuttle service, when available. Otherwise, you may use a ride-sharing service or taxi, or take the Madison Metro Bus. See below for details. We will help organize groups to take shuttles and taxis, based on arrival and departure times. Shuttle/taxi groups will be formed and emailed shortly before the School itself. Travel Between the Hotel and Campus \u00b6 For travel between the School hotel and the Computer Sciences building on campus, walking is a great option. Also, the hotel shuttle service may be available, especially if organized in advance. See below for details. Options for Getting Around \u00b6 Hotel Shuttle \u00b6 The Park Hotel operates a free shuttle service. The shuttle may not be available at all times, though, and it is best to plan ahead. Work with the hotel staff, individually or even better in groups, to use the shuttle. As noted above, we will help organize groups for the shuttle for airport arrivals on Sunday and departures on Saturday. To ask about the shuttle, either stop by the front desk of the hotel, or call +1 (608) 285-8000 and press 0 for the front desk. Explain that you are a guest at the hotel and ask if the shuttle is available for the number of people in your group; be clear about where you want to go from and to and at what time. We will send the hotel our list of groups who would like the shuttle for airport trips, but it is still best for the leader of each group to check with the hotel anyway. Walking \u00b6 It is easy to walk in and around the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison campus, with many Madison landmarks within a mile of the School and your hotel. Use a mapping app or ask us or your hotel for a map. In particular, State Street \u2014 which connects the Capitol Square with the UW campus \u2014 is full of great restaurants and shops and is worth walking along while you are here. City of Madison Metro Bus Service \u00b6 Many Madison Metro buses stop near the hotel and pass through the University of Wisconsin\u2013Madison campus. Bus fare is $2.00, and if using a transfer ask the driver for a free transfer pass upon boarding. You can pay with cash, or, if you prefer, you can download the Madison Metro Transit Fast Fares mobile app, which allows you to add funds and scan a QR code to board the bus. This route does require you to make an account. Google Maps is a great resource for finding the best bus routes to use in Madison, giving multiple route options for each trip. Additionally, the Madison Metro Website provides a web interface to plan your trip. Note Bus routes stop running around ~11pm each day. Taxis and Ride-Sharing Services \u00b6 Both Lyft and Uber are active in Madison, or you can choose from our local taxi companies, such as Madison Taxi and Union Cab . We cannot recommend any particular option, but those are some options we know about. Note We cannot reimburse for any taxi or rideshare service beyond the ride to and from the airport.

If it is not on the receipt, be sure to write the tip amount yourself, so you do not forget. We cannot pay for any alcohol, although non-alcoholic drinks are OK \u2014 ideally, pay for alcohol separately. We will explain the reimbursement process in detail after the School, but the tips above will help.","title":"Meal Reimbursement Tips"},{"location":"logistics/projects/","text":"Continue Your Access to the OSPool \u00b6 Any U.S.-based researcher with an academic affiliation can use the OSPool indefinitely, with no allocation or cost to you.

When travelling, you may experience delays, changes, or cancellations due to weather, mechanical issues, and so on. It is good to be prepared for last-minute changes. Below are some tips and ideas for dealing with travel. For health guidelines, before or during the event, please see our health guidelines page . Checking In Early \u00b6 Airlines generally allow you to check in for your flights the day before. Doing so may save you time and hassle at the airport. Go to your airline website and look for the \u201cCheck In\u201d section, then follow the steps. Finding Flight Status \u00b6 Be sure to check your flight status often, starting the day before travel begins. While you can check the status of each flight individually on the airline website (or a third-party site), you may be able to view your entire trip at once. Go to your airline website, find their section for \u201cMy Trips\u201d or something similar, and use the six-character \u201cConfirmation Number\u201d on your itinerary plus your last name to access your full itinerary, including flight status for each segment. Definitely check your flight status before leaving for the airport! If Your Arrival in Madison Is Delayed \u00b6 If your flights change and you will arrive in Madison later than planned, think about what effect that will have: If you will arrive before Sunday, 6 p.m. (or so), you should be fine. If there is time, you can still go to the hotel first; if it is after 5:30 p.m. (or so), it may be best to go straight to Union South for the welcome dinner at 6:30 p.m. If you will arrive on Sunday but after 6 p.m. (or so), you will miss the welcome dinner. Go straight to the hotel and check in, then find dinner on your own; we can reimburse you in this case. Try to let us know about the situation, when you can. If you will arrive later than Sunday, just do your best to get here. Try to let us know about your situation as soon as you can. We can help deal things like the hotel and may be able to suggest travel options. If you need to make flight changes, see below. If Your Arrival Back Home Is Delayed \u00b6 If you flights back home are delayed, there is not as much that we can do. For example, it is not clear whether we can pay for changes on return flights. Contact your airline to find out how they will get you home. If You Must Make Flight Changes \u00b6 If one or more flights are cancelled, or if we approve flight changes and their fees in advance , you will need to make new plans with your airline. If you are at an airport, it is a good idea to get in line at your airline\u2019s service counter right away. Also, you can try calling their service number while waiting in line! For any change that requires extra payment, you must get our approval and make the change through Fox World Travel , UW\u2013Madison\u2019s only approved travel agency. If you pay for a change any other way, we cannot reimburse you. Fox World Travel phone number: +1 (844) 630-3853 Note: If you call Fox World Travel on the weekend or outside of 7am\u20137:30pm (Central), they will charge us $20 just for calling.

We plan to email everyone about travel soon, but are starting with a small group to find and fix issues. Whether we offered to pay your travel costs or not, please we must hear about your travel plans so that we know when to expect you here. (And if we offered to pay for your hotel room, we will reserve your hotel room for you.) Find the numbered section below that applies to you: 1. We Offered to Pay for Your Travel \u00b6 We want to find reasonable and comfortable travel options for you. At the same time, we must stay within budget and follow University rules about arranging and paying for your travel costs. Let\u2019s work together to find something that makes sense for everyone. Here are ideas that have helped some School travelers in past years: If you are near Madison, consider driving; we can reimburse mileage and tolls up to a point, plus parking. Or look into bus routes, especially from larger cities like Chicago. The buses are very comfortable, have wi-fi, and run frequently. If you fly, try to get flights to and from Madison (MSN) itself . In some cases, we may ask you to consider flying to Milwaukee (1\u00bd hours away) or Chicago (2\u00bd hours away), then taking a direct bus to Madison; we do this only when the costs or itinerary options to Madison are terrible. If you fly, be flexible about departure times \u2014 early and late flights are often the least expensive. We do not like very early or very late flights any more than you do, so we will work hard to find reasonable flight times. Note: Please try to complete your travel plans by about May 30, when rates may go up. Travel by Airplane \u00b6 Do NOT buy your own airline tickets . University rules say that our travel agency, Fox World Travel, must buy your tickets. Please try to complete air travel arrangements by Thursday, 29 May 2025; earlier is better ! Use the following information to get air travel tickets: Start by emailing Fox World Travel (FWT): Send the email to \u201cuwtravel@foxworldtravel.com\u201d As always, CC the School: \u201cschool@osg-htc.org\u201d For the email subject, put something like \u201cOSG School travel request (01UWS037) - \u201d, then your first initial and last name(s) For the email body, repeat that you are requesting flights for the OSG School 2025 (01UWS037), and include your full name, where you are traveling from (city or airport), and where you are returning to If you have special constraints or situations (e.g., other dates, travel companion), explain clearly A FWT agent will email you back with options and/or questions. Watch for this email and respond as soon as reasonable. It may take a few emails back and forth. Please CC the School on all emails. If you prefer, you may call FWT instead: +1 (844) 630-3853. If your itinerary must be approved (see below), then we will use email for that and remaining steps. Make sure FWT has your email address! We must review and approve some itineraries. FWT can purchase tickets directly in many cases, but if the agent says that your trip must be reviewed, do not worry! It just means that we need to check the budget, options, and UW rules. We hope to approve your first choice, or we will work with you and FWT to find another reasonable one. Common reasons for a trip needing review are: total trip cost over $800, leaving too early or arriving too late, travel starting and ending at different locations, and travel on dates other than June 22 and 28. Approval takes time, so it may take 1\u20132 days to get confirmation. Airplane tickets cannot be held without purchase over a weekend, so avoid contacting FWT late on Fridays. Please be considerate of the FWT agent(s) you work with. They work hard to find good options for you, but they must also follow our rules. If you feel that they are not providing the options that you want, you should email us . We will help resolve any issues. Do not argue with the FWT agents, especially about options you find online \u2014 there are many reasons why that option might not be available to us. Travel by Bus \u00b6 For some nearby locations, or in addition to air travel to Chicago or Milwaukee, it may be helpful to take a bus to Madison. Bus companies that School travelers have used often in the past are: Van Galder Bus , especially from Chicago Badger Bus , especially from Milwaukee To get bus tickets, pick one method: Ask us to buy bus tickets for you in advance. This is the easiest option all around. Just email us at school@osg-htc.org ; include your desired travel dates and times, and start and end bus stations or stops. Buy bus tickets for yourself. You may purchase bus tickets yourself before or on the day of travel. If you purchase your own tickets, you must get approval from the School for the estimated cost first, then request reimbursement from us after the School. If you purchase your own tickets, save the original receipt (even if by email). It is best to have a detailed receipt (including your name, itinerary, date of purchase, and total amount paid), but a regular ticket stub (e.g., without your name or date) should work fine. Just get what you can! Be sure to email us with your bus plans, including: Transportation provider(s) (e.g., Van Galder bus) Arrival date and approximate time Departure date and approximate time Arrival and departure location within Madison Actual or estimated cost (indicate which) Travel by Personal Car \u00b6 If you are driving to Madison, you will be reimbursed the mileage rate of $0.700 per mile for the shortest round-trip distance (as calculated by Google Maps), plus tolls. Also, we will pay for parking costs for the week at the hotel in Madison (but not elsewhere). We recommend keeping your receipts for tolls. Note: Due to the high mileage reimbursement rate, driving can be an expensive option! We reserve the right to limit your total driving reimbursement, so work with us on the details. To travel by personal car, please check with us first. We may search for comparable flight options to figure out a reasonable maximum cost. Be sure to email us with your travel plans as soon as possible. Try to include: Departure date from home, location (for mileage calculation), and approximate time of arrival in Madison Departure date and approximate time from Madison, and return location (for mileage calculation) if different than above 2. We Are Not Paying for Your Travel \u00b6 If you are paying for your own travel or if someone else is paying for it, go ahead and make your travel arrangements now! Just remember to arrive on Sunday, June 22, before about 5:00 pm and depart on Saturday, June 28, or whatever dates we suggested directly to you. For other travel dates, check with us first, please!
